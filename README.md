# Capo guru
This is the repository for the React JS application that can be found at [capo.guru](http://capo.guru).
Capo guru takes chord sequences and displays where else they can be played on a guitar using a capo.
All of the musical heavy-lifting is handled by [guitar-chord-sequence](https://github.com/jgjr/guitar-chord-sequence).

It was bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses the [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) React UI framework.
